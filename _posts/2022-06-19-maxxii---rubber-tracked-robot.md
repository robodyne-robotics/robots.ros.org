MaXXII is a skid-steering tracked mobile robotic platform which can be used for a large variety of applications as robot for agricolture and to speed up your robotics research! You can easily add your own sensors or you can ask us to integrate them for you depending on your requirements. Usually, MsXXII is configured with 360Â° Laser Sensor, RGB-D camera, motor encoders, current sensors and RTK GPS with a very high accuracy for autonomous navigation and guidance. Thanks to its rubber tracks, it can be used both for indoor and outdoor applications and its payload allows the users to add additional devices and laptops. Moreover, it provides several power output in order to connect multiple devices. The large ground clearance lets the vehicle to overcome obstacles like rocks and debris.
MAXXII comes with a well-documented ROS node which allows the user to remotely control the robot and to easily integrate sensors, devices and actuators. It also includes C/C++ library for cross-platform development and for third-party integration. The user can move the robot by using the standard geometry_msgs ROS messages.
